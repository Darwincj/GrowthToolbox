GFtbox is a MATLAB program for simulating the
biological growth of curved surfaces such as leaves and petals, and bulk
tissues, and diffusion and interaction of substances over such tissues.

GFtbox requires an installation of MATLAB. It
should run on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. As I always use the latest version
of Matlab, I recommend that users do the same, as I cannot guarantee
that I have not depended on some Matlab feature not present in previous
versions. I believe that all Matlab licences allow free upgrading to the
current version.

After downloading or cloning the repository, you will have a
directory called "GrowthToolbox".  You can place this anywhere you want.
Open MATLAB and cd to this directory.  The command "GFtbox" should then
open the program's GUI. It also adds the GFtbox source code directories
to your MATLAB search path.  If you give the Matlab command "savepath",
then on subsequent runs of Matlab the "GFtbox" command will start GFtbox
without you having to first cd to its directory.

Further information and documentation (a work more in stasis than in
progress) is available at
https://labguide.rico-coen.jic.ac.uk/index.php/Growth\_Toolbox
and
http://cmpdartsvr3.cmp.uea.ac.uk/wiki/BanghamLab/index.php/Software#Quantitative\_understanding\_of\_growing\_shapes:\_GFtbox
All of the documentation is years out of date. This is unlikely to change.

More informative may be two published papers on GFTbox, the first dealing with leaf-like curved surfaces, the second with bulk tissues.
