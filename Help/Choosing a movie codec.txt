The Movie/Codec menu lists all of the compressors that Matlab offers for generating movies.
Not all of these compressors are supported on all platforms. In particular,
on Mac OS and 64-bit Windows Vista some older versions of Matlab do not support ANY
of these compressors, and more recent versions of Matlab (R2011a onwards) only
support Motion JPEG.

Therefore, on some Matlab installations movies must be generated uncompressed, and so may
be very large. They should be compressed with external video processing software before
being uploaded anywhere or used in PowerPoint presentations, because their size will
not only take up excessive space, it will hinder real-time playback.

A suitable program for compressing movies is VirtualDub, a free download from
www.virtualdub.org. Of the compression methods it offers, the one most likely to
generate movies that play everywhere is Cinepak.
