function m = local_setproperties( m )
% This function is called at time zero in the INITIALISATION section of the
% interaction function.  It provides commands to set each of the properties
% that are contained in m.globalProps.  Uncomment whichever ones you would
% like to set yourself, and put in whatever value you want.
%
% Some of these properties are for internal use only and should never be
% set by the user.  At some point these will be moved into a different
% component of m, but for the present, just don't change anything unless
% you know what it is you're changing.
