% Each call of getMgenLevels below returns four results:
% XXX_i is the index of the morphogen called XXX.
% XXX_p is the vector of all of its values.
% XXX_a is its mutation level.
% XXX_l is the "effective" level of the morphogen, i.e. XXX_p*XXX_a.
% In SECTION 3 of the automatically generated code, all of the XXX_p values
% will be copied back into the mesh.

    polariser_i = FindMorphogenRole( m, 'POLARISER' );
    P = m.morphogens(:,polariser_i);
