% Here you may write any functions of your own, that you want to call from
% the interaction function, but never need to call from outside it.
% Remember that they do not have access to any variables except those
% that you pass as parameters, and cannot change anything except by
% returning new values as results.
% Whichever section they are called from, they must respect the same
% restrictions on what modifications they are allowed to make to the mesh.

% The GFtbox_..._Callback routines can be deleted if you do not use them.
% Those that you retain will be automatically called by GFtbox at certain
% points in the simulation cycle.
% If you retain them, their headers specifying their arguments and results
% must not be altered.
