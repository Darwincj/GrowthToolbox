function [s1,s2] = splitStructRec( s, filter, prefix )
%[s1,s2] = splitStructRec( s, filter, prefix )
%   Split the struct s into two structs, whose merger will be s. Those
%   parts of s for which filter is true go to s1, the remainder to s2.
%
%   filter is a function of the form filter( value, name ), where value is
%   the value of the component of s, and name is the full hierarchical name
%   of the component in the struct. It returns 1 if the value is to be
%   selected for s1, 2 if it is to be selected for s2, and 0 if value is a
%   struct to be further split
%   prefix is used only in recursive calls, to indicate where we currently
%   are in the struct tree.
