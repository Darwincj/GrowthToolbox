function m = leaf_stagesmovie( m, varargin )
%   Options:
%
%   start: A time.  The movie will begin with the first stage file at or
%           after that time.  By default the initial state of the project.
%
%   end: A time.  The movie will end with the last stage file at or
%           before that time.  By default the last existing stage file of
%           the project.
%
%   filename:  The name of the file to save to.  By default a name will be
%           chosen automatically.
%
%   leaf_stagesmovie never recomputes any stages.  It makes a movie only
%   from the existing stage files in the specified time range.
