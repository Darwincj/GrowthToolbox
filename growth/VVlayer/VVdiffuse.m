function m = VVdiffuse( m, dt, q, dWW, dMM, dWM, dWC )
%m = VVdiffuse( m, q, dWW, dMM, dWM, dWC )
%  Calculate the diffusion in time dt of a quantity defined by q, diven
%  four diffusion constants:
%       dWW: diffusion along a cell wall
%       dMM: diffusion along a cell membrane
%       dWM: diffusion between cell wall and cell membrane
%       dWC: diffusion between cell wall and cell interior
