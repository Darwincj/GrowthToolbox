%   Recalculate the length of every membrane and wall segment, and the area
%   of every cell.

    % 1.  Get length of every second layer cell wall.
    
    % 2.  Divide each length by the number of segments in that wall.
    
    % 3.  Update vvlayer.segmentLengths, using secondlayer.cellareas for
    %     the cell centre vertexes.
