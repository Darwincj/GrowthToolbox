GFtbox is a MATLAB program for interactive and off-line simulation of the
biological growth of curved surfaces such as leaves and petals, and bulk
tissues, and diffusion and interaction of substances over such tissues.

GFtbox requires an installation of MATLAB, preferably 2019a or later. It
should run on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. As I always use the latest version
of Matlab, I recommend that users do the same, as I cannot guarantee
that I have not depended on some Matlab feature not present in previous
versions. I believe that all Matlab licences allow free upgrading to the
current version.

Users at the John Innes Centre can download GFtbox from our GitHub server
at https://github.com/JIC-CSB/DArT_Toolshed (password required).
You can either download it as a zip file, or, if you are familiar with the
git source code management tool, then you can clone the repository. (If you
are familiar with git, you will know what "cloning the repository" means,
and why this method makes it simpler to keep your copy of GFtbox up to
date.)  This distribution includes several other things besides GFtbox, but
GFtbox is independent of them, and you can ignore them.

Others can download it from Sourceforge, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gftbox/files/
The Sourceforge version is sometimes less up to date than the GitHub
version.

In either case, you will download a zip file. Decompressing this gives a
directory called "GrowthToolbox".  You can place this anywhere you want.
Open MATLAB and cd to this directory.  The command "GFtbox" should then
open the program's GUI. It also adds the GFtbox source code directories
to your MATLAB search path.  If you give the Matlab command "savepath",
then on subsequent runs of Matlab the "GFtbox" command will start GFtbox
without you having to first cd to its directory.

Under GFtbox's Help menu are commands for displaying references to several
published papers about the system.

Further information and documentation (a work more in stasis than in
progress) is available at
